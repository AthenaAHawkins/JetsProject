# JetsProject

# Description
This program will read in from the Jets.txt file and create an arrayList from the jets listed in the text file. It will then take the array list and using methods found primarily in the Airfield, will allow the user to calculate the time traveled, add or remove jets from the arrayLis. 

# Technologies Used
java, eclipse, .txt files

#Lessons Learned
I learned that a lot of my foundations are still pretty shaky, but that I know where I feel weak on and so, I can focus on those areas and work on improving them. Interfaces really confused me before starting this project and the idea of integrating them into a program felt really daunting, but now I see they're no more daunting than any other class truly. As always, I worked on this project with a few friends for over a good 20 hours during the weekend. Working with people helps an immense amount to be able to talk things through and chew on problems together. The most difficult part of this entire program was definitely the text reader as well as the custom reading of a new jet type into the arrayList.
